# Salary Calculator


## Description

it took me approximately 9 hours to complete this project. We had to create a functional website where we had to record the employees input such as firstName,lastName,iD,title, salary. Upon the submit button we had to push our info into a table. We also had to have a delete button that removes the current row. I started by creating a function with a object inside it. the object keys are set to the value the user inputs. I also created another function that appends a table data with the values we grabbed with the first function. the second function has access to the first function because we passed it as a arguement.
